[Chelsea] My name is Chelsea.  
[Chelsea] Can you provide me with your full name?  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] I'm Bridget Case Beer Loring.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] I don't know why it transferred you to me.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] I've made a payment.  
[Chelsea] OK.  
[Chelsea] It probably transferred you to me depending on did you take care of the delinquency.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] I just took care of the one month payment today.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] OK.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] And then they get caught in September with two mortgage payments.  
[Chelsea] OK alright, that's probably why I transferred you to me.  
[Chelsea] Usually when only one payment is made and it's a different delinquency, it will transfer you to the Rep.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] OK.  
[Chelsea] So I could just notate that two payments will be made in September in regards to taking care of the remaining delinquency at that time?  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] Yeah, there's just I'll be one month behind as of tomorrow I think.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] And then because I made the payment today, did I didn't get the confirmation number for the payment today though.  
[Chelsea] Let me see if I can provide it to you.  
[Chelsea] It's.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] Not it's that proof of this call that's fine, it's just it got weird because I was expecting numbers and it was letters.  
[Chelsea] OK, yeah, if you go on the website you can find it.  
[Chelsea] I just don't think I won't be able to provide it to you only 'cause you're not authorized.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] OK, here's the I should be authorized because it's all the mail and stuff comes to me.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] Can you excuse me Jenna?  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] I tried to make this payment online and your drop down menu isn't working like for that.  
[Chelsea] Yes, it yeah.  
[Chelsea] You won't be able to make any payments online when you're delinquent.  
[Chelsea] You all will have to call.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] That's new.  
[Chelsea] That hasn't, yeah.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] But I've been doing it monthly the whole time on the website ever since we started with you guys back in like a year or so ago.  
[Chelsea] Correct.  
[Chelsea] Yeah, they have updated the website.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] That's weird and inconvenient.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] OK.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] So I will call by September 30th to make the two payments.  
[Chelsea] OK.  
[Chelsea] Yes, ma'am.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] As long as but I mean am I gonna be able to access any information now online like.  
[Chelsea] Yeah, you can still access the information, you just probably won't be able to make any payments.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] That's the.  
[Chelsea] Right.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] The game to show that I made the payment today.  
[Chelsea] Yeah, but that's just show that so you can get the confirmation number.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] I'm just super paranoid because we have such a low mortgage that we still struggle with.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] But I mean, I know you guys can spell it for a lot more.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] So it's like I'm super paranoid.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] I just, I gotta say, you know, so when that happened, so when did they change it that you can't make them the web payments if you were delinquent?  
[Chelsea] I'm not too sure they actually since I've been here.  
[Chelsea] I've been here since probably earlier this year, but they've been like making updates on the website frequently.  
[Chelsea] So I'm not really exactly when they exactly the date of when they changed it, but I know it was within this year because they even stopped making advising that we could make part.  
[Chelsea] Guys can make partial payments as of March, there's no, there's no more partial payments that can't be made.  
[Chelsea] So they they're all changing a lot.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] That's not right.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] I mean, people are really struggling right now and I know it's not your fault.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] I.  
[Chelsea] All I'm just struggle, but it is I can say I do give stipulations to the partial payments how it can be made.  
[Chelsea] So like if it's like, because I know partial payments definitely help because I even do partial payments with some of my bills.  
[Chelsea] But I know like with one of the stipulations is if you make a so more than your monthly payment and whatever's left over gets applied.  
[Chelsea] So like an unapplied balance.  
[Chelsea] And then at that point, the next payment you make would have to be the remaining balance to make a full payment with that unapplied.  
[Chelsea] So this is called stipulations of making like partial payments.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] OK.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] OK.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] That makes sense.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] Well, thank you for your time.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] I just it's not showing online that I made the payment and I couldn't get.  
[Chelsea] That it might be due to it's Saturday so if you could look again on maybe Tuesday it should show up.  
[Chelsea] Or even Monday it might It might show up on Monday, I'm not too sure.  
[Chelsea] Only due due to the holiday.  
[Chelsea] That's why I skipped Monday.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] It's like, I mean, I like if I got my husband, would you be able to give him the confirmation code because I wasn't able to get it.  
[Bridget Case Beer Loring] OK, hold on.

[Carlos] Thank you for calling Nations Lending Corporation on behalf of Lawn Care.
[Carlos] This is Carlos.
[Carlos] With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking with?
[Christopher Hill] Christopher Hill.
[Carlos] Good afternoon, Mr. Hill.
[Carlos] How are you, Sir?
[Christopher Hill] I'm good.
[Christopher Hill] How are you?
[Carlos] I'm doing good as well, Sir, and thank you for asking.
[Carlos] Are you still at this time currently occupying your property?
[Christopher Hill] Yes.
[Carlos] Thank you for that information.
[Carlos] I do have a good phone number on file for you Sir.
[Carlos] Phone number ending in 1936.
[Carlos] Is this still a good number of contact for you?
[Christopher Hill] Yes.
[Carlos] And are you the current subscriber on the cell phone contract associated with this phone number?
[Carlos] No.
[Christopher Hill] This is my work phone.
[Carlos] OK.
[Carlos] All right.
[Carlos] Thank you for that information.
[Carlos] I do see that right now we have an account balance that is showing due for the monthly mortgage of August as well as September's mortgage.
[Carlos] The total amount is $2263.44.
[Carlos] We did receive your last payment on July the 31st which was to rectify the July's mortgage.
[Carlos] I do see also online you did advise us the reason that the account is falling behind is due to marital difficulties, is that correct?
[Christopher Hill] Yes, yeah.
[Carlos] OK, Sir.
[Carlos] Well, definitely as a company we're here to work with you and not against you in any way.
[Carlos] So overall, what was your game plan and when you were able to take care of August's mortgage?
[Christopher Hill] Well, I had it scheduled to come out today, but I was trying to, I can't remember what the amount was, but I was trying to add some more to and I think I accidentally canceled.
[Carlos] I'm actually looking I would lead it.
[Christopher Hill] Yeah, yeah.
[Christopher Hill] I didn't mean to do that, but I was trying to pay $1200 on it today.
[Carlos] OK.
[Carlos] I can take care of that for you, Sir.
[Carlos] Not a problem.
[Carlos] Just one moment.
[Carlos] Now, is there a particular reason as to why you're paying just basically a little bit over the monthly mortgage rate?
[Carlos] Were you just trying to include the late charges with that?
[Christopher Hill] Yeah, just I'm trying to get caught up.
[Carlos] OK, just one second from you, Sir.
[Carlos] Now your late charges are showing the amount of $71.56.
[Carlos] So what we'll do is we'll set up the arrangement according to bringing your account completely up to date.
[Carlos] And then therefore, when were you looking to be able to take care of the September's mortgage payment by or when?
[Christopher Hill] I'm hoping, I'm hoping by the 20th, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to make that or not.
[Christopher Hill] I'm trying, that's what.
[Carlos] I'm now the one thing I did want to bring to your attention so I know this.
[Carlos] You're definitely trying to rectify all of your late fees.
[Carlos] If you know that the account will be still able to assess a late fee for the current month of September, then you know the late charges are something that you can rectify at a later time.
[Carlos] The whole purpose of trying to catch the late charges is to avoid a late fee, but however, once the fee has been assessed, it will definitely be something that will still be there until you're in a position that you can take care of it.
[Carlos] I would always encourage all of my customers to get your mortgage as far as the monthly payments taken care of first.
[Carlos] And then when you're in a position that you know that your account will not fall past due again, then definitely that would be the good opportunity to rectify all of your late charges.
[Carlos] So they're not too much.
[Carlos] But again, if you know that you're going to be making payments outside of the 20th of every month, then you're automatically assessing a late fee every month.
[Carlos] So it's kind of like all about how you flip your frequency where whatever has the priority in the beginning of the month, the mortgage will take that place back and then whatever else other bills and all of that can still be consolidated in the middle or the end of the month.
[Christopher Hill] Right.
[Carlos] That's just one option.
[Carlos] So let's go on and get you set up with the August's payment, which will include the late charges as well, Sir.
[Carlos] And that's for the 226344.
[Carlos] Actually, no, it will not be.
[Carlos] 2264 will be just one second for me.
[Carlos] You need help?
[Carlos] Yeah, it'll be.
[Carlos] It'll be 1167.
[Carlos] Fifty will be the amount.
[Carlos] And whenever you're ready, Sir, I just need you to confirm the last four digits of your bank account information that we have on file.
[Christopher Hill] 4788 I believe it is.
[Carlos] Let's see.
[Christopher Hill] That's my debit card.
[Christopher Hill] 8788 is my debit card.
[Christopher Hill] You want my checking account?
[Carlos] Yes, Sir, the best I thought she was going to get the last four digits of your bank account information.
[Christopher Hill] OK, it's a 2485.
[Carlos] Thank you for that.
[Carlos] And also, can you state your full name as it appears on your bank account Sir?
[Carlos] Say it again for me.
[Christopher Hill] Christopher.
[Carlos] Your phone just broke up twice.
[Carlos] Can you just state your full name please?
[Christopher Hill] Christopher L Hill.
[Carlos] Thank you for that information.
[Carlos] And is this a checking or savings account, Sir?
[Christopher Hill] That's checking.
[Carlos] Thank you.
[Carlos] And you are the authorized user associated with this bank, this checking account?
[Christopher Hill] Yes.
[Carlos] Thank you for that information, Sir.
[Carlos] For some reason it's not allowing me to add the late charges into the account, but nevertheless, as I stated before, it would be encouraged to just go on and just do the monthly payments the way they are in the system until you knowing you're in a position that you can just wipe out the entirety of the late charges.
[Carlos] I don't know why it's not allowing me to set it up, but I wouldn't want to keep going back and forth over a $71 fee.
[Carlos] I have a payment dated for September the 5th 2024 in the amount of $1095.94.
[Carlos] This payment will be deducted from your checking account with routing number 253-279-5336 and account number ending in 5485.
[Carlos] Once this payment is processed, I will not be able to delete it.
[Carlos] Do I still have your permission to process this payment?
[Christopher Hill] Sir, yes.
[Carlos] OK.
[Carlos] OK.
[Carlos] Just one moment for me, Sir.
[Christopher Hill] OK.
[Carlos] None.
[Christopher Hill] OK.
[Carlos] All right.
[Carlos] Can I put you on a brief hold, Sir?
[Christopher Hill] Yes.
[Carlos] Thank you for your patience.
[Carlos] I know what the issue is.
[Carlos] We're going to have to set up this payment for tomorrow's date because you have too many transactions are going on on the same day.
[Carlos] It was scheduled at one time to be processed and it was also deleted today.
[Carlos] So that's why I'm having a issue of processing a payment on my end for the same day.
[Carlos] So we're going to set this up for tomorrow's state, OK.
[Christopher Hill] OK, that's fine.
[Carlos] All right, because I'm sitting there wondering why am I having the hardest time processing one payment as long as I've been with this company, but now?
[Christopher Hill] It's my fault.
[Christopher Hill] I shouldn't.
[Christopher Hill] I didn't mean to cancel it a while ago.
[Christopher Hill] I don't know.
[Christopher Hill] It's OK, No worries.
[Carlos] No worries, your payment has been successfully processed from your checking account.
[Carlos] Although it will apply to your loan on the specified date, it can take up to seven business days to be drafted from your bank account, depending on your banking institution.
[Carlos] Would you like your confirmation number?
[Christopher Hill] Yes.
[Carlos] OK, just one moment for me.
[Carlos] Let me know whenever you are ready.
[Christopher Hill] I'm ready.
[Carlos] Your confirmation number, Sir, is 144158 CFN, OK.
[Carlos] Just one moment for me.
[Carlos] Now, of course, the current month is showing due for September's mortgage.
[Carlos] When was the game plan you were looking to take care of that by?
[Christopher Hill] I'm hoping by the 20th but I'm like I said, I don't know, it might be the point by the 27th or 26th.
[Carlos] OK.
[Carlos] I'll just say to be safe, September's mortgage by the 26th.
[Christopher Hill] Yeah.
[Carlos] Of course, if you can do it earlier than that, you'll be giving us a call back to secure that arrangement, unless you want to secure that with me.
[Carlos] Did you want to?
[Christopher Hill] No, I don't want to do that yet.
[Carlos] OK, OK, All righty then.
[Carlos] So I'm going to do a quick recap, Mr. Hill.
[Carlos] Right now, the arrangement that we have is for a payment today for $1095.94 to rectify August's mortgage, and then you'll have another one that will be followed up by the 26th of the month of September to bring your account completely up to date.
[Carlos] Outside of that, is there anything else that I can assist you with?
[Christopher Hill] No, that's it.
[Carlos] OK.
[Carlos] I do want to thank you again for your time and patience going over everything with me.
[Carlos] And we do appreciate you doing business with Nation's Lending Corporation on behalf of Loan Care and you have a great day, OK.
[Christopher Hill] All right, you too appreciate your help.
[Carlos] Not a problem and thank you.
[Carlos] Bye.
[Christopher Hill] Bye bye.

[Raquel] OK.
[Raquel] And I'm sorry, can I have you here?
[Raquel] I have a cell phone number on file ended in 9022.
[Raquel] Are you the kind subscriber associated with that telephone?
[Raquel] Yes, ma'am, cell phone.
[Raquel] And did you give us consent to call and text you at this number using an auto dial or prerecorded voice?
[Jeremy Lindgren] Yes, I do.
[Raquel] OK.
[Raquel] And are you calling to make a payment today?
[Jeremy Lindgren] Yes, I am.
[Raquel] And for the security of your personal information, I will be transferring you back into the phone system to process your regular monthly payment.
[Raquel] Thank you for calling Nation's Lending.
[Raquel] We appreciate your business and you have a wonderful day.
[Raquel] Hello, Thank you for calling Nation's Lending.
[Raquel] My name is Lane.
[Raquel] May I please start by getting your full name as it appears on the mortgage?
[Jeremy Lindgren] Jeremy Lindgren.
[Raquel] Thank you very much for that and I see you've already been pre verified by another agent.
[Raquel] Thank you very much for that.
[Jeremy Lindgren] I want to make my payment should take me back to the automated 1.
[Raquel] That's correct.
[Raquel] I'm sorry to say that we're no longer able to accept payments over the phone with the agents, at least standard monthly payments.
[Raquel] Would you like me to get you back to the payment portal?
[Jeremy Lindgren] I've never used it so I don't know.
[Jeremy Lindgren] Can I do an additional principle with that or will it only take the standard payment?
[Raquel] Unfortunately, at this time it only takes a standard payment.
[Jeremy Lindgren] Cause the reason I'm asking is we, my wife and I received a letter this past spring saying that our mortgage had gone up because of escrow changes or something.
[Jeremy Lindgren] So my payments supposed to be almost $3000 a month.
[Jeremy Lindgren] Your automated system still says my payments are only 25 something.
[Jeremy Lindgren] So I don't want to get a bill later on saying that I'm shorting my payment by 500 bucks because your system won't let me make the full $3000 payment.
[Raquel] That's actually correct.
[Raquel] From what I'm seeing here, the system is only charging you 256520.
[Jeremy Lindgren] Yes and my payment supposed to be like 2956 or some damn thing like that.
[Jeremy Lindgren] So I've been making just a flat $3000 payment.
[Raquel] So actually not quite so, as it turns out.
[Raquel] It says here that this took effect in June.
[Raquel] However, because your escrow balance was brought current, it didn't take effect.
[Raquel] So your payment did increase but it increased to 256520.
[Jeremy Lindgren] OK, so it didn't go to the full 3000.
[Jeremy Lindgren] OK, Yeah, we got the letter saying it went to 3000 and then we never heard anything else from them again.
[Raquel] And my apologies for the confusion.
[Raquel] It just so that way you're aware in the future with the escrow analysis if there is a shortage, you can actually pay off that shortage and it will it won't necessarily prevent your payment from increasing, but it will it will make it so your increase isn't as much.
[Raquel] And so that's that's what happens here.
[Raquel] It did increase a little, but.
[Jeremy Lindgren] Not as much.
[Jeremy Lindgren] It happened and we didn't even know about it so.
[Raquel] Right.
[Jeremy Lindgren] So yeah, I've been making an extra $500 a month payment since June because I thought that's what our payments went to now.
[Jeremy Lindgren] So that's good.
[Jeremy Lindgren] I will make this the 25 and change then.
[Raquel] OK.
[Jeremy Lindgren] All right.
[Jeremy Lindgren] And is all of my account information in the automated system as well?
[Jeremy Lindgren] Because I know you guys have it on file.
[Raquel] We we are asking that you have the bank information ready even for over the phone payments now.
[Jeremy Lindgren] OK, I think I have.
[Jeremy Lindgren] All that punching and all the routing number and all that stuff is a pain in the ***.
[Raquel] OK, well, was there anything else I can help you with today before I transfer the call?
[Raquel] No.
[Jeremy Lindgren] I think that'll be everything.
[Raquel] OK, perfect.
[Raquel] Well, in that case, I do want to thank you again for calling Nation's Lending.
[Raquel] We do appreciate your business and please be sure to explore Nation's Lending servicing.com And other than that, we hope you have a great rest of your day.

[IVR] Hello, thank you for calling your customer Care center.  
[Isla] My name is Isla.  
[Isla] Thank you for coming through our automated system fully verified.  
[Isla] Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Christopher Ramirez.  
[Isla] Hi, Christopher, How are you today?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] I'm doing well.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] How are you doing?  
[Isla] I'm doing good, thank you.  
[Isla] If you don't mind, I'd like to take a moment to update your telephone number on file.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] I do see a number.  
[Isla] Ending in 1779.  
[Isla] Is that still a good number?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Yes.  
[Isla] Excellent.  
[Isla] Are you the current subscriber associated with the cell phone contract with this number?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Yes.  
[Isla] And do you give us consent to call and text you at the cell phone number using an automated dialer or pre recorded voice?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] No.  
[Isla] Thank you so much for allowing me to update that.  
[Isla] Would you like to make a payment today?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] I'm going to actually just use your automated phone payment.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Sure, but I was and I'll be doing that today.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] But I was calling regarding another matter.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] I got a voicemail this morning, probably most likely from someone from the escalation department.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] And I was wondering if you could transfer me to someone who is in the escalation department because I do have some additional concerns that are regarding that, that that would you, would you, would you, what would you call it?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] And if that gives us an incident report or is that escalated?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Yeah, it's a case.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] It's a case actually.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Sorry.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] So they put a case forward and they tried calling me today.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] And so if you could transfer me to the appropriate individual or individuals, I'd appreciate it.  
[Isla] Absolutely.  
[Isla] Let me just go into your notes and see where I need to make sure you get to customer.  
[Isla] OK, there was a message left.  
[Isla] It says that if the customer calls back, please advise that our tax department is already in progress of retrieving the tax refund.  
[Isla] We've submitted a request to have an advanced deposit to escrow for tax refund while we are ready to receive.  
[Isla] Once updates are provided, we'll advise.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Do you still have any additional?  
[Isla] Questions.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Did you put that in layman's terms?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Because I'm having to look up culture translating, what exactly all that means?  
[Isla] So what that means is that we went ahead and requested from your tax department a refund and we are waiting for them to go ahead and refund that amount back into your escrow.  
[Isla] And as soon as we have an update for that escrow payment being placed back into your escrow, we will go ahead and give you a call back.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] OK.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] So that means that they were able to finally confirm that a payment was sent from loan care that was didn't need to be sent because that that prop that supplemental tax had already been paid.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Can I translate your message that way too?  
[Isla] Correct.  
[Isla] So now.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] They're asking.  
[Isla] For that refund back from the tax department.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] And then what about the the penalty?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Will that be remedy too?  
[Isla] That I'm unsure of, but I can definitely get you up to escalations to know about that, OK.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Yeah, I definitely would like to ask about that.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] And then I also would like to ask them because I did receive two pieces of mail today from loan care that changed my updated my mortgage payment because of this escalation case matter.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] So be good to get some reassurances from them that what you know, what's going to happen now, because they're, you know, they're asking for more money for my October loan.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Care is asking for a higher mortgage payment beginning October 1st.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] And so I'm a little concerned about that too.  
[Isla] Absolutely.  
[Isla] I would be as well.  
[Isla] So yes, I can absolutely get you up to escalations for those additional questions.  
[Isla] Is there anything else that I can do for you before we get you transferred?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] No, thank you all.  
[Isla] Right.  
[Isla] I'm going to put you on a brief hold and get up to escalations and then they'll be with you shortly, OK?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] OK.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Thank you so much.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] And what was your name?  
[Isla] Isla ILA.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] ILA OK.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Thank you so much, Isla.  
[Isla] Absolutely.  
[Isla] Hold please.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Thank you.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] None.  
[Steven] The.  
[Steven] The.  
[Steven] Hello.  
[Steven] Hello, Mr.  
[Steven] Ramirez.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Yes.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Is this Steven?  
[Steven] This is Steven.  
[Steven] Yes, Sir.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Hey, how you doing?  
[Steven] Pretty good.  
[Steven] How are you?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Pretty good.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Every time I hear your voice it relaxes me a little bit, I think.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Well.  
[Steven] Thank you for that.  
[Steven] And I was talking to Isla.  
[Steven] I was looking at the parcel numbers here.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] And.  
[Steven] Looking at the parcel numbers, I think it brought to mind that I may have spoken.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] To you before, yes.  
[Steven] So, but you said you had a few questions about, you know, we're chasing down a refund for you.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Yeah, I know You just said you're supplement.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Yeah, yeah.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] You're chasing down the refund for, for for me right now and then the penalty it will that be remedied the 385 when all this is resolved?  
[Steven] Right.  
[Steven] I mean, if, if you've already satisfied the tax payment yourself, I think that's what I always said.  
[Steven] What we get back should be everything that we sent.  
[Steven] So we sent the 211540 and the 385 so that that should be coming back in.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Yeah, it's $2540.40.  
[Steven] Yeah.  
[Steven] The downside of it is that after that disbursement was made, yeah, there was a new escrow analysis done that accounted for, you know, that those funds being out of there.  
[Steven] So that that's actually affecting the payment in the meantime.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Yeah.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] So you, you, you, you, you go, you just went transition quite nicely to my next question that's going to be due October 1st.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] So what's what's going to happen?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Could you give me some direction here?  
[Steven] Well, ideally we'd be able to get these funds back into the account before then and possibly modify the payment by October if it doesn't happen by then.  
[Steven] I mean, the payment itself looks like it increased 14843.  
[Steven] All the difference would wind up going into escrow, so it's not like those funds would disappear, but.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] OK, so even if I, if I in the worst case scenario that I that the circumstances are still being the case is still being resolved, excuse me, that that money will, is still that money able to be added as a surplus to my escrow account?  
[Steven] Right.  
[Steven] It'll just be building up in the escrow and then once we get the refund back, it may trigger a new escrow analysis.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] OK.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] All right.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] So and then I think you said that this situation could probably take 6 to 8 weeks at most I think.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] So there might be a possibility that then that I would, you know that this might not potentially be remedied before October 1st, but but if not then everything will be adjusted accordingly.  
[Steven] Right.  
[Steven] The the refund could take some time.  
[Steven] The other part of this though, was that, yeah, I think we had the the parcel number listed in there that was for your neighbor's property.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Yeah.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Did that get already remedied?  
[Steven] Not yet that that's you know when, when we spoke back on the third, you know, I opened up a request to go ahead and address that and that result in the case being opened.  
[Steven] So there should be a case manager that will be following up with you periodically as we work to get that resolved.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] OK, sounds good.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Well, you give me a sense of calm right now because when I got those, when I woke up to some new mail and I saw two different escrow assessments in the mail and each one just kept going higher.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] I was like, oh jeez, what's what's going on here?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] So I just wanted to, to touch base with you again.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] And I know they called me this morning to touch base with me just to let me know that that they, that you have all have put in a request for the refund from the tax collector.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] And yeah, so, so for that 202,500 five $140.40 that includes that 385 penalty that hopefully will will be run refunded to my account from the tax collector, correct.  
[Steven] Right.  
[Steven] And looks like based on the notes here, the agent who called you, he made a note that we're actually asking to see if that amount can just be credited to the escrow even before we get the refund.  
[Steven] So it'll minimize.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] The impact so.  
[Steven] That that's.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] How does that work?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] How?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] How would that work?  
[Steven] Well, I mean, if, if it can be done, basically those funds would be credited to the escrow, OK.  
[Steven] And then when the actual refund comes back, you know it's already accounted for in your escrow so that you know the cash team would just process that themselves, but basically.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] OK.  
[Steven] The cash team would kind of be.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Given up.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] If it actually if it happens that way, then that's actually even better, huh?  
[Steven] That would, yeah, that would jump start the ability to go ahead and update the payment to a more reasonable payment closer to where it was.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] OK, sounds wonderful.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Well, those are my questions today Steven and that really helps me and every like I said every time I talk to you, I was it's always a better situation.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] So thank you SO.  
[Steven] Much thank you for that.  
[Steven] Thank you for giving us the chance to help you here, but.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Yeah, No, no, thank you.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] This is this is I'm starting to see a silver lining to all this, which is great because this whole process has been going on since I think probably June or or May even I'm not sure how far back this week.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Yeah, it's been it's been a ride in a little stressful.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] And I told myself, you know, I'm like, I'm going to call in and I'm going to just try to stay, you know, really calm with all the new information today.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] So.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Yes, Sir.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Yeah, OK.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Thank you so much.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Have a great day.  
[Steven] You too.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] I look forward to getting another update in the near future.  
[Steven] Other than the tax and escrow question though, was there anything else I might help you with?  
[Christopher, Ramirez] No, not today.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] Thank you.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] It just sounds like, you know, continuation that this is heading the right way now.  
[Christopher, Ramirez] So I'm really happy about that.  
[Steven] Yes, Sir, a work in progress, so to speak.

[Alex] My name is Alex.  
[Alex] Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with?  
[User] My name is Leslie.  
[Alex] Can I get your last name as well please?  
[User] Yeah, it's Gorsky.  
[Alex] Thank you.  
[Alex] I'm sharing a phone number ending in 7573 and one ending in 5000.  
[Alex] Are these numbers still good?  
[User] The 5000 is no good at the.  
[Alex] Other level.  
[Alex] And are you the current subscriber on the cell phone contract associated with that number?  
[User] That was like a work phone number, but I don't work there anymore.  
[Alex] I meant for that 7573.  
[User] Oh yeah, yes, that's my phone number.  
[Alex] And do you give us consent to call and text you at that cell phone number using an auto dialer or pre-recorded voice?  
[User] Sure.  
[Alex] Thank you.  
[Alex] Since you mentioned you're not planning on moving soon, you're eligible for a complimentary mortgage checkup to explore potential options with your available equity.  
[Alex] After we address the reason for your call, may I bring a Lakeview mortgage professional on the line to discuss these options with you?  
[User] Yeah.  
[Alex] Thank you.  
[Alex] OK.  
[Alex] And what can I help you with?  
[User] I have two questions actually.  
[User] One I was just looking at like paying some bills and looking at my bank account and it looks like my mortgage payment came out and then I think it like came back into my account because it looks like I withdrew.  
[User] I just wanted to make sure, but when I it looks like it was current when I called so I just want to make sure it went through.  
[Alex] Let me take a look here.  
[Alex] It's still showing on my end.  
[Alex] It can take up to seven business days to process though, so I would just like give it a week and if it still hasn't come out of your bank account, call back.  
[User] OK.  
[User] But it's showing current on your end.  
[User] Yes, OK, OK.  
[User] And then the other question I had was I was told when we bought the house in New York once there's a loan that our PMI was going to come off.  
[User] Actually it would be this this month, but it looks like my total amount has my mortgage amount has gone up by $200.  
[User] I wasn't sure why that was.  
[User] I was expecting it to actually be a little bit lower.  
[Alex] OK, now let me take a look.  
[Alex] So the mortgage insurance is off of your account and then we did the annual review of your escrow, which also pays taxes and insurance.  
[Alex] Looks like both your Township taxes and your homeowners insurance increased.  
[Alex] So to recover from paying more than we collected and to collect more for those higher amounts going forward, your payment had to be increased.  
[User] OK, OK, as long as I just had an explanation I'm fine with that.  
[Alex] Sure.  
[Alex] Anything else I can assist you with or would you like to speak with that mortgage professional now?  
[User] I'm all set.  
[User] I can speak with the mortgage person.  
[User] Thank you.  
[Alex] OK.  
[Alex] Thank you for calling Lakeview Loan Servicing.  
[Alex] We appreciate your business and somebody will be with you in just a moment.  
[User] OK.
